# Introduction
Welcome to the GoLang Basics repository! This repository is designed to help you learn the basics of the Go programming language (GoLang). Whether you're new to programming or already have experience with other languages, this guide will help you get started with GoLang.

# Prerequisites
Before diving into learning GoLang, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Basic understanding of programming concepts.
A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed on your machine.
GoLang installed. You can download and install it from the official GoLang website.
Getting Started
To start learning the basics of GoLang, follow these steps:

Setup GoLang Environment: Ensure GoLang is properly installed on your machine. You can verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
        go version

Understanding Go Syntax: Familiarize yourself with GoLang syntax, including variables, data types, functions, loops, conditionals, and error handling. You can find resources like the official GoLang Tour or Go by Example to learn these concepts.

Writing Your First Go Program: Create a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started. Open your text editor or IDE, create a new file named hello.go, and write the following code:

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory containing hello.go and run the following command:


go run hello.go
You should see Hello, World! printed to the console.

Exploring Go Packages: Learn about Go packages and how to import them into your code. Explore the standard library packages and how to use them in your programs. The GoLang documentation is a great resource for finding and understanding available packages.

Working with Go Modules: Understand how to work with Go modules to manage dependencies in your projects. You can initialize a new Go module in your project directory using the following command:


go mod init <module-name>
This command creates a new go.mod file to manage dependencies.
